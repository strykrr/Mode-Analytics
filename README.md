### Drop in Engagement 

 Hypothesis  listing down the cause for drop in Engagement of Yammer Application
 
 1)Holiday Season leading to absence of Employees.
   
   This particular assumption can be persued since any particular region of the world could be having major festive or holidays season   which might have brought down the number of users.The Behavioral pattern across all the regions is common after disgnosing which rules out the reason for having holiday season in one particular region.

 2)Low Productivity of the Server and lack of support from Yammer causing failure of application.
  
  There is lack of information to diagnose the reason for lack of productivity which can be further investigated by looking at the logs reports
   
 3)Traffic Shutdown or Maintenance isssues in companies to cut down the cost.
   
   There is a possibility for  few of the companies to not continue the applications in order to save the Administrative costs.This has been diagnosed  but the pattern seems ambiguous as the number of users increased for few countires and also dropped for few others.
 
 4)Upgrades to the current version of Application slowing down the performance.
 
   Yammer might have realesed new version with additional features which might have compromised user Experience.Below URL clearly shows the drop in engagement during the period of Aug 04 for Mobile Devices. Yammer can further investigate into the issues for failures reported during the month of August on Mobile Devices.

  5)Retention of Existing Users and Enrollment of New Users.
    
    The growth of any appliction can be attributed to the number of users signing up every week and the usage is proportional to the total number of users logging every week.Below url shows that the number of users have dropped in the week of Aug 04 which could have         contibuted signnificantly to the drop in Engagement.
